
<!-- Static Data Member -->
1. They are the attributes of class or class member.
2. It is declared using Static keyword.
3. Only one copy of that member is created for the entire class and is shared by all the object
4. It is initialize before any object of this class is created.


<!-- Encapsulation -->
**Encapsulation** is the concept of wrapping data (variables) and code (methods) together as a single unit. In object-oriented programming, this is typically achieved by making the data members of a class private and providing public methods to access and modify them. This helps to protect the internal state of the object and only expose necessary functionality.

**Key Points:**
1. Encapsulation binds data and functions that manipulate the data into a single unit called class.
2. It restricts direct access to some of an object's components, which is a means of preventing unintended interference and misuse.
3. Access to the data is provided through public methods (getters and setters).
4. Improves code maintainability, flexibility, and security.


<!-- Abstraction -->
**Abstraction** is the process of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. In object-oriented programming, abstraction allows you to focus on what an object does instead of how it does it.

**Key Points:**
1. Abstraction simplifies complex systems by modeling classes appropriate to the problem.
2. It hides unnecessary details from the user and exposes only relevant information.
3. Achieved using abstract classes and interfaces in many programming languages.
4. Helps in reducing programming complexity and effort.
