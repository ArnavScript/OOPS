# 🔷 Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs)

Welcome to my OOPs (Object-Oriented Programming System) learning repository!  
This repository contains my notes and code examples based on **core OOPs concepts** which I learned from **Rohit Negi Bhaiya** — a mentor who made OOPs feel like second nature with his conceptual clarity and real-life analogies.


## 📘 What is OOP?

**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields (attributes), and code in the form of procedures (methods).
It helps in modeling real-world scenarios, reducing complexity, improving code reusability, and increasing maintainability.



## 🚀 Topics I’ve Covered

### ✅ 1. Classes & Objects
- Creating templates for real-world entities
- Instantiating and using objects

### ✅ 2. Encapsulation
- Wrapping data and methods into a single unit
- Using private fields and public getters/setters

### ✅ 3. Abstraction
- Hiding internal complexities and showing only essential features
- Abstract classes and interfaces

### ✅ 4. Inheritance
- Reusing properties and methods of existing classes
- Types: Single, Multiple, Multilevel, Hierarchical

### ✅ 5. Polymorphism
- **Compile-time:** Function and operator overloading
- **Run-time:** Method overriding and virtual functions
- 

## 🧠 Additional Concepts Explored

- 🔸 Constructor & Destructor
- 🔸 Access Modifiers (`private`, `public`, `protected`)
- 🔸 Static Members & Static Methods
- 🔸 Operator Overloading (C++)
- 🔸 Abstract Classes vs Interfaces
- 🔸 Deep Copy vs Shallow Copy
- 🔸 Virtual Functions & V-tables (C++)


🙏 Special Thanks
📚 Rohit Negi Bhaiya — Thank you for making OOPs feel like storytelling. Your teaching turned abstract logic into real-world intuition. Every concept now feels alive in my code.
