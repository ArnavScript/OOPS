# Polymorphism in OOP (C++)

Polymorphism is a core concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. It enables a single interface to represent different underlying forms (data types).

## Types of Polymorphism

1. **Compile-time Polymorphism (Static Binding)**
    - Achieved using function overloading and operator overloading.
    - The function to be invoked is determined at compile time.


2. **Run-time Polymorphism (Dynamic Binding)**
    - Achieved using inheritance and virtual functions.
    - The function to be invoked is determined at runtime.


## Key Points

- **Virtual functions** enable run-time polymorphism.
- **Base class pointers** can point to derived class objects.
- Polymorphism increases flexibility and reusability of code.
