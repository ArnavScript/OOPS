Exception handling is a programming technique used to manage errors or unexpected situations that occur while a program is running. Instead of crashing when something goes wrong (like dividing by zero or trying to open a missing file), exception handling lets you detect the problem and respond gracefully.

**Key concepts:**
- **Exception:** An error or unexpected event that disrupts the normal flow of a program.
- **Try/Catch (or Try/Except):** Blocks of code where you "try" to run code, and "catch" exceptions if they happen.
- **Throw :** throw the exception if occurs/happen in try block  
- **Finally:** (in some languages) A block that always runs, whether or not an exception occurred.

**Why use exception handling?**
- Allows you to "throw" (or "raise") exceptions intentionally when your code detects an error condition.
- Makes code more robust and user-friendly.
- Allows you to log errors or clean up resources (like closing files).
